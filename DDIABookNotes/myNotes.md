- message brokers are used as follows: one process sends a message to a named
queue or topic, and the broker ensures that the message is delivered to one or more
consumers of or subscribers to that queue or topic. There can be many producers and
many consumers on the same topic.

- A key design goal of a service-oriented/microservices architecture is to make the
application easier to change and maintain by making services independently deploya‚Äê
ble and evolvable

- REST is not a protocol, but rather a design philosophy that builds upon the principles
of HTTP. It emphasizes simple data formats, using URLs for identifying
resources and using HTTP features for cache control, authentication, and content
type negotiation
