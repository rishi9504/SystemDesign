 # Key components and design decisions of this Traffic Signal Control System:

1. System Architecture
   - The system follows a hierarchical structure with the TrafficSignalController at the top
   - Each intersection contains multiple traffic signals
   - The system uses dependency injection and interfaces for flexibility and testing

2. Key Components:
   - SignalState: Enumeration for different signal states (RED, YELLOW, GREEN)
   - TrafficSignal: Represents individual signals with configurable durations
   - Intersection: Manages multiple signals at a single intersection
   - TrafficDetector: Interface for traffic detection with concrete sensor implementation
   - TrafficSignalController: Main controller coordinating the entire system

3. Features Implementation:
   - Emergency Vehicle Handling:
     - The TrafficDetector interface includes emergency vehicle detection
     - When detected, the system enters emergency mode and adjusts signals accordingly
   
   - Dynamic Signal Timing:
     - Signal durations are adjustable based on traffic density
     - The system includes base and maximum durations that scale with traffic
   
   - Scalability:
     - The design allows adding new intersections and signals easily
     - The TrafficDetector interface can be extended for different detection methods
     - New vehicle types and signal states can be added through enums

4. Safety Considerations:
   - Signals have default durations for fallback
   - State transitions are managed carefully
   - Emergency mode ensures all other signals are red

5. Extension Points:
   - New vehicle types can be added to the VehicleType enum
   - Different traffic detection strategies can be implemented
   - Signal timing algorithms can be modified or enhanced
   - Additional states or special conditions can be added
