Designing an ATM System

The ATM system should support basic withdrawal and deposit operations, as well as balance inquiry. It should also handle transactions with multiple accounts and multiple users.

The system should be able to handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages to the user.

The system should be able to interact with bank backend to validate user accounts and perform transactions.

The system should be able to handle concurrent access to accounts and transactions.

ATM should be able to dispense bills and coins.

The card should have a unique serial number and should be authenticated by the pin.


We can enhance this ATM System with the following improvements:

Card Locking Mechanism after multiple failed login attempts.
Transaction History Tracking for each account.
Bill Denomination Handling during withdrawals.
Error Logging and Exception Handling.
Support for Bank Backend API Integration.
Currency Conversion Support for international accounts.
Concurrent Session Handling with Redis instead of a simple lock.
Real-Time Notifications via email or SMS after each transaction.
